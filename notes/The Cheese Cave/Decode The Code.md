The *Decode the Code* challenges present snippets of code designed to test your ability to predict their behaviour without executing them. These snippets often exploit the finer details of a programming language, pushing you to analyse its quirks and edge cases. The main goal is to figure out what the code will do and why it behaves that way. Even if you do not guess the exact output, it is a fun and rewarding challenge to uncover the logic hidden within.
